# Predictive-Modelling
build a predictive model using machine learning algorithms to predict the expected number of rentals in a given day

**Tasks Division for Simplicity: **
1. Import the data from daily-bike-share.csv and view the first few rows.
2. Create Histogram to visualise data for feature 'temp' and 'windspeedâ€™. And add lines for the Mean and Median on the plot.
3. Separate features and labels- Use X : features, y : labels.
4. Split 70% data for training and 30% testing.
5. Use Linear Regression Algorithm to model the data set.
6. Evaluate the trained model by predicting some input data.
7. Use R -squared to find the accuracy of the model.
